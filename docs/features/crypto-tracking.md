# Feature: Crypto Tracking

> Last updated: 2026-07-17

## Context

Picsou tracks cryptocurrency holdings from two sources: centralized exchanges (Binance) and on-chain wallets (Bitcoin, EVM, Solana). The `EVM` chain is a **multichain fan-out**: a single `0x` address is tracked across every enabled EVM network (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche C-Chain) — see the [EVM multichain wallets ADR](../decisions/2026-07-17-evm-multichain-wallets.md). Exchange credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. On-chain wallets query public blockchain RPCs (no API key). All crypto balances are converted to EUR via the `PriceService`.

## How it works

### Three subsystems

1. **CryptoExchangeSyncService** -- Manages exchange connections. Stores encrypted API key + encrypted secret in `CryptoExchangeSession`. Both fields are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Fetches holdings, converts to EUR via `PriceService.refreshPrices()`, and upserts a single account per exchange with per-coin holdings in `AccountHolding`.

2. **WalletSyncService** -- Manages on-chain wallet addresses. Stores chain type + address in `WalletAddress`. Fetches balances via `WalletPort` (a list — native asset plus any tokens), prices each ticker, sums to EUR, and upserts one account with a per-ticker `AccountHolding`. Does NOT store a ticker on the account itself to prevent double price conversion (the account balance is already in EUR).

3. **PriceService** -- Provides EUR prices for crypto tickers via CoinGecko. See [price-service.md](./price-service.md).

### AES-256-GCM encryption

`CryptoEncryption` handles encryption/decryption of API keys and secrets stored in the database. Both `apiKey` and `apiSecret` are encrypted. It uses `AES/GCM/NoPadding` with a 12-byte IV and 128-bit tag. The IV is prepended to the ciphertext before Base64 encoding. The encryption key is provided via the `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (Base64-encoded 256-bit key). The app **refuses to start** if the key is not set. See [encryption-at-rest.md](./encryption-at-rest.md) for full details.

### Binance adapter

`BinanceAdapter` implements `CryptoExchangePort`. It calls the Binance REST API (`GET /api/v3/account`) with HMAC-SHA256 signed requests. Returns a list of `CryptoHolding` records for all assets with non-zero balances (free + locked). The `testConnection()` method validates credentials before saving.

### Bitcoin wallet adapter

`BitcoinWalletAdapter` implements `WalletPort`. It supports three input formats for the address field:

- **Plain address** (`bc1q...`, `1...`, `3...`) -- Single address lookup via Blockstream Esplora API.
- **Extended public key** (`xpub...`, `zpub...`) -- BIP32 HD wallet key derivation. Derives P2WPKH addresses (BIP84) along external (`m/0/*`) and change (`m/1/*`) chains.
- **Output descriptor** (`wpkh([fingerprint/path]xpub.../chain/*)#checksum`) -- Proton Wallet format, normalized to xpub before derivation.

The adapter scans each chain until `GAP_LIMIT` (20) consecutive unused addresses are found (BIP44 standard). `BitcoinKeyUtils` provides BIP32 key derivation, Base58Check decoding, and Bech32 encoding.

### EVM wallet adapter (multichain fan-out)

`EvmWalletAdapter` handles the `EVM` chain — one `0x` address, every enabled EVM network. It iterates a registry of networks (`EvmNetwork{ displayName, nativeSymbol, rpcUrl, tokens }`), all keyless PublicNode RPCs:

| Network | Native | RPC |
|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | ETH | `ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| BNB Chain | BNB | `bsc-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| Polygon | POL | `polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| Arbitrum | ETH | `arbitrum-one-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| Optimism | ETH | `optimism-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| Base | ETH | `base-rpc.publicnode.com` |
| Avalanche C-Chain | AVAX | `avalanche-c-chain-rpc.publicnode.com` |

For each network it calls `eth_getBalance` for the native coin (wei→coin, 18 decimals on all these chains) and one `eth_call` `balanceOf(address)` per curated ERC-20/BEP-20 token. `eth_getBalance`/`eth_call` are byte-identical across EVM chains — only the RPC URL, native symbol and token list differ. The networks are queried **concurrently** (a reactive `Flux` fan-out, not a sequential loop), each call bounded by a 10s timeout and a small backoff retry, so total latency is roughly the slowest chain rather than the sum of ~20 calls. The raw transport is a thin `EvmRpc` seam (`(rpcUrl, request) → Mono<JsonNode>`); the adapter layers timeout, retry, error-classification and envelope validation around it, which also lets tests stub it by request content.

Balances are **aggregated by symbol** before returning: ETH held on Ethereum + Arbitrum + Optimism + Base rolls into one `ETH` entry, and a stablecoin held on two chains sums into one — which also keeps `WalletSyncService`'s per-ticker holding upsert (unique on `account_id, ticker`) collision-free. Token coverage is a **curated** contract list per network (only tokens `PriceService` can price and whose contract is verified), mirroring Solana's `KNOWN_MINTS` — full auto-discovery would need an API-key explorer (see the ADR).

### Solana wallet adapter

`SolanaWalletAdapter` calls `getBalance` on the Solana mainnet RPC (`api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`). Returns balance converted from lamports to SOL (9 decimals). It also calls `getTokenAccountsByOwner` to pick up known SPL stablecoins (USDC/EURC/USDT).

### JSON-RPC error handling

The on-chain adapters (EVM, Solana) validate the JSON-RPC envelope through `JsonRpcResponse.requireResult(response, context)` (`adapter/util/`) before reading a balance. A present `error` field, a missing `result`, or an empty response throws `WalletRpcException`, which `WalletSyncService` surfaces as a `422` sync failure. This is deliberate: reading `result` with `path(...)` returns a non-null `MissingNode`, so an error payload would otherwise default to a **silent 0 balance** — indistinguishable from a genuinely empty wallet. A real `0x0` / `value:0` result still returns 0. On Solana, an error on the SPL-token call fails the whole sync rather than silently dropping stablecoin holdings.

`WalletSyncService.sync()` splits its catch: **expected** failures (`WalletRpcException`, `SyncException`) log at `WARN` and become the friendly `422`; **unexpected** ones (NPE, `ClassCastException`, …) log at `ERROR` with the full stacktrace so a real bug can't hide as a transient sync. `WalletRpcException` has no dedicated `@ExceptionHandler` — it stays wrapped in `SyncException`, which keeps the `422` mapping. Two per-item cases inside the Solana adapter are **not** fatal, to avoid one bad field hiding the rest of the wallet: a non-array token `value` and a malformed `uiAmountString` are logged (WARN / ERROR respectively) and that one entry is skipped, while SOL and every parseable token still come through. `resyncAll()` returns a `ResyncSummary(total, succeeded, failed)` so its callers (the daily scheduler and the `trigger_crypto_wallet_sync` MCP tool) can report per-wallet outcomes instead of a blanket "done".

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| AES-256-GCM (symmetric) | Simple, no external dependency; sufficient for single-user self-hosted app | HashiCorp Vault, cloud KMS (overkill for self-hosted) |
| No ticker on wallet accounts | Balance is already converted to EUR at sync time; storing a ticker would cause `PriceService.toEur()` to multiply a second time | Store ticker and handle conversion in dashboard (risk of double conversion) |
| BIP32 key derivation in Java | Full control over derivation; no native library dependency | Use a separate Bitcoin library (unnecessary complexity) |
| Blockstream Esplora (public) | Free, no API key needed, reliable | Run own Electrum server (too much for self-hosted) |
| EVM multichain fan-out over keyless RPC | One `0x` address = many chains; `eth_getBalance`/`eth_call` are identical across EVM chains, so one adapter covers all with no API key | Per-chain wallet entries (re-typed address); Etherscan/BscScan API-key explorer (breaks keyless convention) — see ADR |
| Curated ERC-20 contract list per chain | Only tokens `PriceService` can price and whose contract is verified; keyless `balanceOf` needs the contract up front | Auto-discover every token via an indexer/explorer (needs API key + rate limits) |
| GAP_LIMIT=20 | BIP44 standard; covers the vast majority of HD wallets | Custom gap limit (not configurable, hardcoded) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY required**: The app refuses to start without it. Lost key = cannot decrypt existing secrets = must re-enter exchange credentials.
- **No ticker on wallet accounts**: Wallet accounts have `ticker = null` and `provider = "BTC"/"ETH"/"SOL"`. The balance is already in EUR. Do not set a ticker on wallet accounts -- it will cause double price conversion.
- **Bitcoin xpub vs zpub**: Both are supported. `BitcoinKeyUtils.normalizeToXpub()` converts zpub to xpub before derivation. The derivation always produces P2WPKH (native segwit) addresses.
- **Output descriptor parsing**: Descriptors are parsed by extracting the xpub between brackets. The checksum after `#` is ignored. Complex descriptors (multisig, P2SH-wrapped) are not supported.
- **Exchange holdings use PriceService**: Holdings are converted to EUR at sync time using `PriceService.refreshPrices()`. If the price cache is stale (older than 15 min), prices are refreshed on demand.
- **Wallet RPC errors must not read as 0**: When parsing a blockchain JSON-RPC response, always go through `JsonRpcResponse.requireResult(...)` — never `response.path("result")` directly. `path(...)` returns a `MissingNode` for an error payload, which silently becomes a 0 balance (this caused the July 2026 Ethereum outage). `requireResult` uses `get(...)` to reject a missing/error result while still allowing a legitimate `0x0` / `value:0`.
- **Don't re-throw `WalletRpcException` raw from `sync()`**: it has no `@ExceptionHandler`, so a raw re-throw becomes a `500`, not the friendly `422`. Keep it wrapped in `SyncException`. The split catch is only about **log level** — unexpected errors log at ERROR with a stacktrace; the user-facing status/message is unchanged.
- **Per-token Solana failures are logged, not fatal**: a malformed `uiAmountString` or a non-array token `value` is logged and skipped so the SOL balance and other tokens survive. Only an envelope-level RPC `error`/missing-`result` (via `requireResult`) fails the whole sync. Loud (logged) ≠ fatal (thrown) — pick per blast radius.
- **EVM fan-out failure isolation is asymmetric**: a network whose native `eth_getBalance` probe fails **fails the whole sync** — it propagates as `WalletRpcException` → `422`, leaving the wallet un-synced with its last balance. Silently dropping a chain would understate net worth while still marking the wallet synced, the same "never read a failed RPC as 0" rule as the July 2026 outage. A single `balanceOf` error, by contrast, skips just that one token (a token call only runs *after* the network's native probe succeeded, so it's a per-asset problem — a reverting/non-standard contract — not a down chain), consistent with Solana's per-token handling. Loud (logged) ≠ fatal (thrown), chosen per blast radius.
- **Transport failures must classify as `WalletRpcException`, not bugs**: the shared `rpc(...)` helper wraps any non-`WalletRpcException` (connection reset, HTTP 5xx, timeout, retries exhausted) into a `WalletRpcException` before it leaves the reactive chain. Otherwise a raw `WebClientException`/`TimeoutException` would (a) hit `WalletSyncService`'s `catch (Exception)` **ERROR-as-genuine-bug** branch instead of the friendly WARN/422, and (b) escape the per-token `onErrorResume(WalletRpcException)` and abort the whole multi-chain sync. An empty body is turned into a failure via `switchIfEmpty` so it isn't read as a 0 balance.
- **EVM balances aggregate by symbol**: the same symbol across chains (ETH on L2s, USDC on several chains) is summed into one `WalletBalance`. This is intentional (net-worth total) **and** required — the caller upserts holdings unique on `(account_id, ticker)`, so un-aggregated duplicates would clobber each other.
- **EVM display ticker is a seeded native**: `fetchBalances` seeds the primary network's native (ETH) at zero so it always leads the returned list — `WalletSyncService` reads `balances.get(0)` as the account's display ticker, and a token-only or empty wallet must still read as the native, not whichever token was found first. The zero seed is dropped by the caller's positive-amount guard, so it never becomes a holding.
- **Wallet sync prunes stale holdings — keyed on *held*, never on *priced***: after upserting current balances, `WalletSyncService` calls `AccountService.pruneHoldings(account, keptTickers)` to delete `AccountHolding` rows for assets no longer held. `keptTickers` is built from the adapter's **positive on-chain balances**, deliberately *not* from which prices resolved this cycle. This distinction is load-bearing: `CoinGeckoPriceProvider.getPricesEur` swallows errors and returns an empty map on an outage, so keying prune on priced tickers would empty the set during a transient CoinGecko blip and `deleteByAccountId` would wipe **every** holding (and its `averageBuyIn` cost basis). A held-but-unpriced asset keeps its last row untouched. An empty `keptTickers` (genuinely empty wallet) clears all holdings. Without any pruning, a sold/moved-out token lingers and inflates `liveBalanceEur` forever — a real hazard now that the multi-token EVM fan-out makes disappearing tickers routine.
- **Protecting holdings is not the same as protecting the balance**: the prune rule above keeps the `AccountHolding` rows through a price outage, but the EUR *total* is computed from prices — so a total outage summed to `0` and that zero was written to `account.currentBalance` **and** stamped as today's `BalanceSnapshot`, flattening the net-worth chart for a transient failure while the holdings sat there looking healthy. `sync` now refuses: if the wallet holds assets (`amount > 0`) and **none** of them priced, it throws `SyncException` (422) so nothing is written and the wallet keeps its last balance — the same "never read a failed fetch as 0" rule the RPC layer follows. A **partial** outage still records a partial total deliberately, because refusing to snapshot whenever any single obscure token is unpriced would block snapshots indefinitely; those are logged per ticker. A genuinely empty wallet prices nothing and still syncs, since nothing is held.
- **`toEur` returns the balance UNCONVERTED when no rate is available**, and logs ERROR saying so. The number is then wrong, not merely missing — a USD balance flows into net worth as though it were EUR. It is deliberately not thrown and deliberately not zeroed: `toEur` backs `liveBalanceEur`, the dashboard and the history charts, so throwing would 500 all of them on one missing FX rate, and substituting zero would understate net worth just as quietly. Changing the number either way shifts every user's totals; making the failure loud does not.
- **Token failures are summarised per network**: each skipped token logs its own WARN, but with seven chains queried concurrently those lines scatter. `fetchNetwork` also emits one `N of M tokens failed` line per network, because the ratio is the part that matters — the sync still succeeds on the native balance, so without it a user can conclude their tokens are gone when the calls merely failed.
- **Retry is transport-only, and bounded**: the shared `rpc(...)` helper retries twice with a 200ms backoff, but `filter(ex -> !(ex instanceof WalletRpcException))` excludes JSON-RPC error payloads — a node answering "method not found" or "rate limited" answers the same way three times, so retrying only delays the failure and triples load on an endpoint that may already be throttling. `onRetryExhaustedThrow` re-surfaces the *original* cause rather than reactor's `RetryExhaustedException`, which would otherwise miss `WalletSyncService`'s expected-failure catch and read as a bug. Pinned by the `transientTransportFailure_*` / `jsonRpcErrorIsNotRetried` tests — before those, deleting `retryWhen` outright broke nothing.
- **Unpriced holdings are excluded from `liveBalanceEur`, and now say so**: skipping is deliberate (never value an asset at a guess), but during a price outage it silently shrinks the balance and any snapshot taken from it. `AccountService.liveBalanceEur` logs a WARN per excluded holding so the dip is explicable. This is the read-side counterpart to the wallet sync refusing to write a fully-unpriced balance.
- **Adapter coverage is verified at startup**: `WalletSyncService.verifyAdapterCoverage` (`@PostConstruct`) fails boot if any `Chain` has no `WalletPort` bean, or more than one. Dispatch is a `findFirst` over injected beans, so without it a missing adapter would surface only when a user syncs that chain (a 422 reading "isn't supported yet"), and a duplicate would silently let whichever bean loaded first win. This is what makes `WalletPort.chain()` returning `Chain` rather than `String` actually pay off.
- **Concurrent syncs of one wallet converge on one account**: `resolveAccount` does find-then-insert, so a double-click (or a user sync racing the scheduler) can have both callers see no account and both insert — two accounts for one wallet, splitting its snapshot history. The insert is wrapped so a `DataIntegrityViolationException` re-resolves to the winning row instead of failing. Note this **narrows** the window rather than closing it: `account.external_account_id` carries only a plain partial index (V6), not a unique one, so there is no constraint guaranteeing the loser actually fails. Closing it properly needs a dedup pass plus a unique index across every sync path (bank, exchange, Finary, wallet), which is deliberately out of scope here.
- **Case conversions on identifiers must pass `Locale.ROOT`**: `WalletSyncService` builds the account key as `"wallet_" + chain.name().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT) + "_" + id`, and tickers are upper-cased the same way before they meet `CoinGeckoPriceProvider`'s (likewise `Locale.ROOT`-keyed) price map. Under a Turkish/Azeri default locale a bare `toLowerCase()` turns `BITCOIN` into `bıtcoin` (dotless ı), so `resolveAccount` would miss its existing row, create a *second* account, and strand the original's snapshot history and `averageBuyIn`. No **repair** migration exists for already-mangled keys: the shipped container pins `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` so no Docker deployment can have written them, and a migration matching a mangled pattern risks corrupting correct rows. Only a JAR run directly on a Turkish-locale host could be affected.
- **BSC stablecoins are 18-decimal**: USDT/USDC on BNB Chain use 18 decimals, unlike the 6-decimal versions on Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Optimism/Base. Decimals live per-token in the `EvmNetwork` registry; get them right or the amount is off by orders of magnitude.
- **New EVM token/network = two edits**: add the `Erc20Token`/`EvmNetwork` row in `EvmWalletAdapter` **and** ensure its symbol maps to a CoinGecko id in `CoinGeckoPriceProvider.TICKER_TO_ID`, or the balance is fetched but dropped from the EUR total.
- **Addresses are validated up front for the error message, not for durability**: `WalletSyncService.addWallet` guards a null chain and a blank address, then calls `WalletPort.validateAddress(trimmed)`, all before attempting a sync. The payoff is a **400** naming the expected format instead of a **422** "try again later" for input that can never succeed, plus no wasted RPC/explorer round-trip. It is *not* what keeps a bad row out of the database — `WalletSyncService` is class-level `@Transactional`, so a throwing `sync()` already rolls the insert back. Don't delete the guards believing the transaction makes them redundant, and don't delete the transaction believing the guards do. The port default is a no-op (Bitcoin's several encodings and Solana's base58 aren't cheaply checkable offline); `EvmWalletAdapter` overrides it. Note the two-exception split: `validateAddress` throws `IllegalArgumentException` (**400**, user typo) while the fetch-time `requireEvmAddress` throws `WalletRpcException` (**422**, an already-stored address that no longer parses). Same regex, different blast radius.
- **CoinGecko: expected outages return no prices; genuine bugs propagate**: the three fetch methods swallow *upstream* failures and return an empty map. Callers treat a missing price as "not valued this cycle", never "not held" (see the prune gotcha above), so a price blip must not fail a wallet sync. Severity is graded by *whose problem it is*: **WARN** for anything we can only wait out (429 rate-limit, 5xx outage, timeout with its duration, unreachable API), **ERROR** for a request we built wrong (400/404 — likely a bad `TICKER_TO_ID` coin id). Every line names the tickers, and bodies are truncated to 200 chars so one bad gateway's HTML page can't fill the log. **If you alert on ERROR you will not be paged for a CoinGecko outage** — deliberate, since these run on a scheduler per ticker and would otherwise emit ERROR for hours; alert on WARN for outage visibility. Anything that is *not* an upstream failure (NPE, `ClassCastException`, a parse defect) is **rethrown**: a bug that presents as "no prices" is indistinguishable from a quiet outage and would never get fixed. Keep the empty-map contract for the upstream cases, or the prune logic becomes destructive.
- **The catch must unwrap before classifying**: `Mono.timeout()` signals a *checked* `TimeoutException`, so `.block()` delivers it wrapped in a reactor `ReactiveException`. Matching on the declared type without `Exceptions.unwrap` silently stops catching timeouts — the most common real CoinGecko failure — and, now that unexpected types are rethrown, converts them into propagating errors. `CoinGeckoPriceProviderTest.timeout_returnsNoPrices_andWarns_despiteReactorWrapping` pins this.
- **Rethrowing is only safe because the batch loops are guarded**: `SchedulerService.dailySnapshots` (per account), `SchedulerService.refreshPrices` (per member) and `PriceService.backfillHistoricalPrices` (per ticker) each try/catch their loop body. `dailySnapshots` is `@Transactional`, so without its guard one failing price lookup would abort every remaining account **and member** and roll back the snapshots already written in that run; `backfillHistoricalPrices` runs from `PriceBackfillRunner`, an `ApplicationRunner`, where an unguarded throw fails Spring Boot startup outright. Do not remove a guard without also restoring the swallow-everything catch. Each guard logs at **ERROR**, not WARN: since expected outages never reach them, anything caught there is a bug, and a WARN would re-hide exactly what the adapter now rethrows to make visible. `PriceServiceTest.backfill_continuesPastAFailingTicker_andLogsItAtError` pins both halves (loop continues, level is ERROR).
- **The intraday chart degrades per ticker, not wholesale**: `HistoryService.buildIntradayHistory` guards each ticker's `getIntradayPricesEur` call, logging ERROR and omitting that series. Without it a single bug 500s the entire `/api/history/intraday` response. Note the fix deliberately lives in the *loop*, not in `PriceService.getIntradayPricesEur` — wrapping the service method and returning an empty map would re-hide bugs on that path, which is the thing this whole arrangement exists to prevent.
- **`prices` payloads are parsed defensively**: `forEachPricePoint` checks each step (`prices` is a list, each entry is a >=2 list, both slots are `Number`) instead of casting, skipping malformed points and warning **once per call** rather than per point. A wholesale format change degrades to empty data plus one warn, instead of a `ClassCastException` propagating into the snapshot batch.

## Tests

- `CryptoEncryptionTest` -- unit tests for encrypt/decrypt roundtrip
- `BitcoinKeyUtilsTest` -- unit tests for BIP32 derivation, address generation
- `CryptoExchangeSyncServiceTest` -- unit tests for exchange management
- `WalletSyncServiceTest` -- unit tests for wallet sync
- `JsonRpcResponseTest` -- envelope validation: valid/zero/empty-array results returned; null/error/missing/explicit-null throw
- `WalletSyncServiceTest` -- RPC error wrapped as `SyncException` (wallet not marked synced), empty balances throw, `resyncAll` summary reports failed chains, holdings pruned to the currently-held tickers, held assets kept when prices are unavailable, malformed address rejected before anything is persisted
- `WalletEvmMigrationTest` -- Testcontainers/PostgreSQL: the `ETHEREUM` &rarr; `EVM` migration converts the wallet, rewrites `external_account_id` to exactly what `WalletSyncService` recomputes, preserves holdings and their `averageBuyIn` cost basis, leaves other chains and unrelated external ids untouched, renames the default `"ETHEREUM Wallet"` account while preserving a user label — including the trap case of a label that is *itself* `"ETHEREUM Wallet"` (V55) — and is idempotent when the real migration file is replayed on already-migrated data
- `EvmWalletAdapterTest` -- concurrent multi-network fan-out via a content-routed `EvmRpc` stub: aggregation by symbol (native across chains, token across chains), token `balanceOf` at correct decimals, native probe failure fails the whole sync for both JSON-RPC-error and **transport** errors (never read as 0), transport error on a token skipped (not fatal), malformed-hex / missing-`result` / null-body all throw, empty-`0x` call as zero, seeded native leads for a token-only/empty wallet, malformed address rejected before any RPC call, and `validateAddress` rejecting as a 400 while accepting EIP-55 mixed case
- `SolanaWalletAdapterTest` -- SOL + SPL parsing, unknown-mint drop, RPC-error fails sync, non-array/malformed token skipped (non-fatal)
