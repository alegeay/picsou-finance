/**
 * In-memory-only holder for the freshly-created admin credentials so the

 *
 * Deliberately NOT using Zustand persist — the password must never hit
 * sessionStorage or localStorage. If the user refreshes mid-wizard, we
 * simply lose the auto-login capability and the Done screen falls back
 * to the "Go to login" CTA. Worse UX, but strictly safer than any form
 * of persisted password.
