## Context

Picsou syncs bank accounts from French banks. In 1.0.0 the active provider is Enable Banking (PSD2, open banking). A second provider — Powens / Budget Insight (screen scraping) — is implemented behind `BankConnectorPort` but disabled because it has not been tested against a real Powens tenant. The scheduler runs daily auto-sync at 08:00 for all linked requisitions.

## How it works

### Provider architecture

Both providers implement the `BankConnectorPort` interface with four operations: `initiateConnection`, `exchangeCode`, `fetchBalances`, and `searchInstitutions`. The service layer (`SyncService`) never imports adapters directly -- it depends only on the port.

**Enable Banking** (`EnableBankingBankConnector`): Uses the PSD2 Bank Account Data API. Auth is JWT-based (RS256 signed with an RSA private key). Sessions are created via OAuth redirect. After the user authorizes, accounts are linked asynchronously and polled up to 3 times with 1.5-second delays (≤ 4.5 s total). If the session still has no accounts, the adapter returns an empty list rather than throwing; `SyncService` keeps the requisition in `FAILED` so the user can retry from the UI without losing the session id. The previous 24 s blocking poll caused 502 errors at the reverse proxy.

**Powens** (`PowensBankConnector`) — ⚠ experimental, disabled in 1.0.0. Uses screen scraping via the Budget Insight API. Auth is an OAuth webview that handles bank selection and credential entry. The OAuth code is exchanged for a permanent access token. Gated behind `@ConditionalOnExpression` (so it only registers when `POWENS_CLIENT_ID` is set), but `@Primary` was removed for 1.0.0, so Enable Banking remains injected even when the bean is registered.

### Requisition lifecycle

1. **CREATED** -- `SyncService.initiateConnection()` calls the port and stores a `Requisition` with `authLink`.
2. **LINKED** -- `SyncService.completeConnection()` exchanges the OAuth callback code, fetches balances, upserts at least one account, and marks the requisition as LINKED.
3. **FAILED** -- If the code exchange or balance fetch fails, or if Enable Banking returns zero accounts after polling, the requisition is marked FAILED and can be retried via `retrySync()`.

### Account type detection

`SyncService.detectType()` maps provider metadata (product name, cash account type) to the `AccountType` enum. Keywords like "pea", "lep", "livret", "titre" in the product string are matched case-insensitively. The `cashAccountType` field (e.g. "SVGS") is used as a fallback. Default is `CHECKING`.

### Flow

```
User initiates connection
        |
        v
SyncController.initiate() --> SyncService --> BankConnectorPort.initiateConnection()
        |                                         |
        |                          Enable Banking: POST /auth (RSA JWT)
        |                          Powens: build webview URL
        |
        v
User authorizes in browser --> redirect to /api/sync/complete?code=xxx
        |
        v
SyncController.complete() --> SyncService.completeConnection()
        |                         |
        |                         v
        |               BankConnectorPort.exchangeCode() --> session_id
        |                         |
        |                         v
        |               BankConnectorPort.fetchBalances(session_id)
        |                         |
        |                         v
        |               upsertAccount() with detectType()
        |                         |
        |                         v
        |               AccountService.upsertSnapshot()
        |
        v
SchedulerService.dailyBankSync() --> SyncService.resyncAll()
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Dual providers with `@Primary` | PSD2 can't access LEP/PEA/livrets; scraping covers all French account types | Single provider only |
| `@ConditionalOnExpression` for Powens | No-code activation: set env var, adapter appears; unset, it disappears | Feature toggles, profiles |
| Keyword-based type detection | Banks rarely expose a standardized type field; product name is the most reliable signal | Hardcoded institution-to-type mapping |
| Async polling for Enable Banking accounts | EB links accounts asynchronously after OAuth; polling (8x3s) handles the delay | Webhook (EB does not provide one) |
| Permanent access token for Powens | Powens tokens do not expire; stored directly as the requisition ID | Refresh token rotation (not needed) |

## Enable Banking onboarding caveats

Two pitfalls cost real users a lot of time during 1.0.0 testing — both are surfaced in the wizard now (`EBStep1Explain`, `EBStep2Credentials`):

- **PRODUCTION vs SANDBOX**: The Enable Banking developer dashboard defaults to SANDBOX, which only exposes fictitious test banks. A user who creates a SANDBOX application will reach the bank picker, see a list of unfamiliar test banks, and never find their real one. The wizard now shows a warning encart on step 1 and forces the user to tick a "my application is in PRODUCTION mode" checkbox before submitting credentials on step 3.
- **PSD2 scope is current accounts only (`CACC`)**: PSD2 standardises consent for cash accounts. PEA, Assurance Vie, Livret A, and other savings/investment products are out of scope — Enable Banking has no API for them. This is a permanent product limitation, not a Picsou bug. Users should be directed to the dedicated integrations (Trade Republic, BoursoBank sidecar, Finary) or manual entry. The wizard surfaces this on step 1, and `BankSyncTab` repeats the note above the connection list.

## Enable Banking configuration: the configured pieces

Enable Banking needs the following, stored/loaded in **two different places** — a distinction that has confused operators:

| Piece | Stored in | Set via |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application ID | DB (`app_setting`) or `ENABLEBANKING_APPLICATION_ID` | Setup wizard / Admin → Integrations |
| Redirect URI | DB (`app_setting`) or `ENABLEBANKING_REDIRECT_URI` | Setup wizard / Admin → Integrations |
| **RSA private key** | **Filesystem** (`/data/keys/enablebanking-private.pem` in Docker, `backend/.local/keys/enablebanking-private.pem` in dev), or `ENABLEBANKING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` / inline `ENABLEBANKING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Setup wizard keypair step / **Admin → Integrations keypair panel** |

**Application ID == Key ID.** Per Enable Banking's [quick-start spec](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/quick-start/) the JWT header `kid` *is* the application's ID and the private key file is named `<applicationId>.pem` — so the "Key ID" is never a distinct value. Picsou therefore collects **only the Application ID** (in both the wizard and the admin page) and derives the Key ID from it: `EnableBankingConfigProvider.keyId()` returns an explicitly-configured value if present (legacy `ENABLEBANKING_KEY_ID` env / `key-id` DB row, kept for backward compatibility), otherwise falls back to `applicationId()`. `SetupService.writeEnableBankingConfig(applicationId, redirectUri)` writes the `key-id` row in lock-step with `application-id` so a later app-id change can't be shadowed by a stale DB key-id (which, being DB-first in `resolve()`, would otherwise win).

`EnableBankingConfigProvider.isConfigured()` requires app id + key id + redirect URI + a parseable private key; `isConfiguredLenient()` / `privateKeyPresent()` are cheap, **non-parsing** checks used by status surfaces and the admin integration toggle (so a malformed key reports as "present" rather than 500-ing the page — the parse error surfaces at real use in `privateKey()`).

Because the text fields (Application ID + Redirect URI) live in Postgres while the key is a file, they can be "saved" while the key is absent — e.g. configuring via the Admin page, abandoning the wizard after the credentials step, or losing the `/data/keys` volume while the DB survives. Symptom: institution search / sync fails with a `SyncException` (HTTP 502).

**Recovery / management:**
- The **Admin → Integrations → Enable Banking** section shows a readiness banner naming every missing piece (incl. the private key) and provides a keypair panel to **generate** (idempotent — never invalidates an already-uploaded public key) or **import** a `.pem`. Endpoints: `POST /api/admin/settings/enablebanking/keypair` and `/keypair/import` (mirror the wizard's but without the setup-complete guard, so they work post-setup). `GET /api/admin/settings` returns `enableBanking.privateKeyPresent`.
- Connector errors are **field-specific**: `EnableBankingBankConnector` names the single missing piece (e.g. *"Enable Banking private key is missing on the server…"*) instead of a blanket "not configured", so the operator knows exactly what to fix.

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **Powens is disabled in 1.0.0**: `@Primary` was removed from `PowensBankConnector`, so even setting `POWENS_CLIENT_ID` will NOT activate Powens — Enable Banking stays injected. To re-enable after validating the adapter, restore `@Primary` on `PowensBankConnector` and set `POWENS_CLIENT_ID`.
- **Enable Banking RSA key**: The private key must be PKCS8 PEM format. The `ENABLEBANKING_PRIVATE_KEY` env var can contain literal `\n` characters -- both formats are handled in `parsePem()`. The key lives on disk, **not** in the DB — see "Enable Banking configuration" above; setting only the text fields (Application ID + Redirect URI) leaves searches failing until a key is generated/imported.
- **Local dev key path**: the `dev` Spring profile stores the generated key under `backend/.local/keys/enablebanking-private.pem` so bare-metal macOS/Linux runs do not try to create Docker's `/data/keys` directory at filesystem root.
- **The callback URI must be HTTPS — a plain-HTTP deployment cannot sync banks.** Enable Banking rejects `http://` redirect URLs for PRODUCTION applications, and PRODUCTION is the only mode that lists real banks (see the SANDBOX pitfall above), so there is no HTTP escape hatch. Docker deployments must therefore terminate TLS: either the bundled `tls` compose profile (`docker compose --profile tls up -d`, see [docker-deployment.md](./docker-deployment.md)) or an existing reverse proxy. Note that Enable Banking never *fetches* the callback URL — the redirect is browser-side only (`window.location.href = authLink`, then the SPA POSTs the `code`) — so a certificate from Caddy's internal CA works fine on a LAN, as long as the family's browsers trust its root.
- **Enable Banking redirect URI must be registered**: `ENABLEBANKING_REDIRECT_URI` defaults to `https://localhost:5173/sync/callback` for local development, matching Vite's HTTPS dev server. In production, set it to the public frontend callback URL (for example `https://picsou.example.com/sync/callback`). The exact same URL must be registered in the Enable Banking developer portal under the application's Redirect URIs. A mismatch causes a `REDIRECT_URI_NOT_ALLOWED` 400 error at auth initiation — it surfaces in the Add Account modal bank wizard.
- **ALREADY_AUTHORIZED**: If the OAuth code is reused (e.g. browser back button), `SyncService.completeConnection()` catches the error and falls back to refreshing the latest linked session instead of failing.
- **Type upgrade on resync**: If the user has not customized an account's type, `upsertAccount()` will upgrade it from CHECKING to the detected type on the next sync. Manual user changes are preserved (only CHECKING is auto-upgraded).
- **Both providers are optional**: The app starts fine without either. No `BankConnectorPort` bean is required at startup.
- **Bank logos**: `InstitutionData.logoUrl` (Enable Banking only — Powens hardcodes `null`) is captured at connection time and copied onto each `Account`. See [bank-logos.md](./bank-logos.md) for the capture/backfill flow and the account card fallback to `color`.

## Tests

- `SyncServiceTest` -- unit tests for type detection, upsert logic, retry flow
- `EnableBankingConfigProviderTest` -- DB/env resolution precedence, and `keyId()` falling back to the Application ID vs honoring an explicitly-configured value
- `EnableBankingBankConnectorTest` -- JWT build / institution search against a mocked provider
- `AdminControllerTest` -- `getSettings` reads the resolved provider; `updateEnableBanking` delegates the 2-arg writer
- `IntegrationsServiceTest` -- `isEffectivelyEnabled` = stored flag OR detected config (env/DB/session presence)
- Manual integration testing against real provider APIs
