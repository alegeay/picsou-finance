# Picsou — User Manual

> Version: **1.0.0**
> Audience: end-users (households self-hosting Picsou)
> Date: 2026-04-26

Welcome to Picsou — your self-hosted personal-finance dashboard. This
manual covers what Picsou does, how to set it up, and how to use every
feature day to day.

---

## 1. What is Picsou?

Picsou is a private dashboard for your money. It aggregates:

- **Bank accounts** — synced from Enable Banking (PSD2/OAuth, 2000+ EU
  banks)
- **Brokerage** — Trade Republic positions
- **Crypto** — Binance balances and on-chain BTC / ETH / SOL wallets
- **Loans / debts** — with on-the-fly amortisation
- **Savings goals** — with manual or automatic contributions

It is single-instance and single-tenant: one Picsou install serves one
household. Your data never leaves your server.

---

## 2. Getting started

### 2.1 First launch

When you open Picsou for the first time, the **Setup wizard** appears.
It walks you through:

1. **Admin account.** Create the first user (this is the owner of the
   instance; that user can later invite others).
2. **Security.** Confirm the URL Picsou is served from (CORS), whether
   cookies should be marked `Secure` (yes for HTTPS, no for plain
   HTTP dev), and where to store the encryption key.
3. **Integrations** *(optional)*. Set up Enable Banking, Trade
   Republic, Binance, Finary import — you can skip and add them later.

When the wizard finishes, Picsou redirects you to the login screen.

### 2.2 Logging in

Enter your username and password. If you have enrolled 2FA, you are
asked for a 6-digit code from your authenticator app (or one of your
recovery codes). Tick **Remember Me** to stay logged in on this device
for 90 days.

### 2.3 Two-factor authentication

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA. Go to **Settings → Security**:

1. Click **Enable two-factor authentication**.
2. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
   (1Password, Google Authenticator, Authy, …).
3. Enter the 6-digit code shown by the app.
4. **Save your recovery codes.** Store them in a password manager — they
   are the only way back if you lose your phone.

To disable 2FA later, you must re-enter your password and a current
TOTP code.

### 2.4 Managing your sessions

In **Settings → Security → Active sessions**, you can see every
"Remember Me" session that is still valid (device label, last seen IP,
last seen at). Revoke any session you do not recognise.

### 2.5 Changing your password

In **Settings → Profile → Change password**, enter your current and
new password. Picsou automatically re-issues your session cookies, so
you stay logged in on this device — every other device is signed out.

## 3. Navigating Picsou

Picsou's main views are reachable from the sidebar:

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Dashboard** | Net worth over time, P&L, contributions, recent transactions |
| **Accounts** | Every account, with detail page and holdings |
| **Transactions** | Searchable list of every transaction |
| **Holdings** | Stocks, ETFs, crypto positions with live prices |
| **Goals** | Savings goals with calendar donut and breakdown |
| **Debts / Loans** | Loans with amortisation chart and progress card |
| **Sync** | Bank, broker, exchange, wallet sync wizards |
| **Family** | Members, sharing, family-wide dashboard |
| **Settings** | Profile, security, theme, integrations |
| **Admin** *(admin only)* | Members management, integrations, security |

The sidebar collapses on mobile; tap the menu icon to expand it.
Picsou supports light and dark themes — toggle from
**Settings → Appearance**, the choice is remembered.

---

## 4. Dashboard

The dashboard shows your **net worth** over a chosen time range
(1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, all-time, or a custom
window). Below the chart you find:

- **P&L** — gain/loss across the window
- **Contribution breakdown** — how much of the change came from new
  deposits vs. price movement
- **Holdings card** — top positions with live prices
- **Recent transactions**
- **Goals progress**

The time range is independent per chart — changing the dashboard
range does not reset the holdings or goal charts.

---

## 5. Accounts

### 5.1 Adding an account

Click **+ Add account** on the Accounts page. Choose:

- **Bank account** — opens the bank-sync wizard (see §6).
- **Brokerage** — manual or Trade Republic.
- **Crypto exchange** — Binance.
- **On-chain wallet** — paste a BTC xpub/zpub/descriptor, ETH or SOL
  address.
- **Manual account** — name, type (checking, savings, PEA, LEP, real
  estate, …), currency, starting balance.

### 5.2 Editing & deleting

From an account's detail page, click **Edit** or **Delete**.
Deleting removes its transactions and holdings — exporting your data
first is recommended.

### 5.3 Real estate

Real-estate accounts have a metadata pane: address, surface, valuation
notes. Edit the value to log a re-evaluation; Picsou snapshots it like
a regular account.

---

## 6. Bank sync (Enable Banking)

1. Go to **Sync → Bank**.
2. Pick your country, then your bank.
3. Picsou opens the bank's authorization page.
4. Authorise; you are redirected back to Picsou.
5. Your accounts appear under **Accounts**, with balances.

Every linked bank is re-synced **daily at 08:00**. To trigger a
manual re-sync, click **Sync all** on the dashboard or the Sync page.
A failed sync shows a red badge with a **Retry** button.

> **Note.** Picsou 1.0.0 only ships with Enable Banking enabled.
> Powens / Budget Insight and BoursoBank adapters exist in the codebase
> but are experimental and disabled in this release.

---

## 7. Brokerage — Trade Republic

1. Go to **Sync → Trade Republic**.
2. Enter your phone number and PIN.
3. Confirm with the SMS code Trade Republic sends you.
4. Picsou pulls your portfolio (positions, cash balance, ISINs).

Holdings appear under **Holdings**; their live prices are refreshed
every 15 minutes from Yahoo Finance (with OpenFIGI converting ISIN
codes to Yahoo tickers).

---

## 8. Crypto

### 8.1 Exchanges

Add a Binance account from **Sync → Crypto → Binance**. Provide a
**read-only** API key and secret. Picsou stores them encrypted with
AES-256-GCM and uses them only to fetch balances.

### 8.2 On-chain wallets

Paste a BTC xpub / zpub / output descriptor, an ETH address, or a SOL
address. Picsou queries public RPCs (Cloudflare for ETH, the
Solana public RPC, electrum-style endpoints for BTC) and shows the
balance. No keys are ever required — addresses only.

---

## 9. Goals

A goal is a target amount tied to one or more accounts.

1. **Create a goal:** name, target amount, target date, contributing
   accounts, sharing level *(optional, for family members)*.
2. Picsou tracks contributions either:
   - **Automatically** — the increase in linked-account balance is
     credited to the goal.
   - **Manually** — record a one-off contribution from the goal page.
3. The **calendar donut** shows month-by-month progress; the
   **breakdown** lists each contribution.

Goals can be **shared** with family members at a `READ` or
`READ_WRITE` level.

---

## 10. Loans / debts

Add a debt with principal, APR, term in months, start date, and any
fees. Picsou computes the amortisation schedule on the fly:

- **Progress card** — paid-off vs. remaining
- **Monthly breakdown** — principal, interest, balance per month
- **Cost summary** — total interest, total fees, true cost
- **Amortisation chart** — over the life of the loan

You can mark a loan as paid off when the balance reaches zero, or
record an early repayment by editing the principal.

---

## 11. Family & sharing

Picsou supports a household — typically 1 to 5 people sharing one
instance.

### 11.1 Roles

- **Admin** — the user who completed the setup wizard, plus anyone the
  admin promotes. Admins can invite, deactivate, rename, reset
  passwords, and reset 2FA for other members.
- **Member** — manages their own data and views shared resources from
  others.

### 11.2 Inviting a member

In **Family → Members**, click **+ Invite**. Provide a username and a
temporary password. The new member logs in and is asked to change
their password on first sign-in.

### 11.3 Sharing resources

Each member's data is private by default. To share an account, a
holding, or a goal:

1. Open the resource.
2. Click **Sharing**.
3. Pick the members and a level — `READ` (view only) or
   `READ_WRITE` (contribute).

The **Family view** on the dashboard aggregates net worth across every
member you can see.

### 11.4 Admin impersonation

An admin can act on behalf of another member. Switch member from the
sidebar dropdown — every page reflects that member's data until you
switch back. Operations are still audited under the admin's identity.

---

## 12. Data export (GDPR)

You own your data. Go to **Settings → Security → Export my data**:

1. Re-enter your password (gate against session theft).
2. Pick which domains to include (everything by default).
3. Download the ZIP.

The archive contains one CSV per domain — accounts, transactions,
holdings, goals, debts, wallets, bank connections, sharing,
balance snapshots, profile. CSVs are UTF-8 with a header row.

---

## 13. Demo mode

If you want to evaluate Picsou without setting up a database, run the
frontend with `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` (or click **Demo** on the login
screen of a built-in demo build). Demo mode serves frozen sample data
and never calls the backend.

---

## 14. Settings reference

| Section | Setting |
|---------|---------|
| **Profile** | Username, password, language *(EN/FR — best-effort)* |
| **Security** | 2FA enrol/disable, recovery codes, active sessions, data export |
| **Appearance** | Light / dark theme, sidebar density |
| **Integrations** *(admin)* | Enable Banking credentials, Trade Republic URL, exchange keys |
| **Family** | Sharing rules, roles |

---

## 15. Mobile

Picsou's frontend is fully responsive. Every page works on a phone:

- The sidebar collapses to a slide-in drawer.
- Charts adapt to portrait orientation.
- Modals are full-screen on small viewports.

Picsou has been tested on Safari iOS, Chrome Android, and Firefox
Android. If you find a layout issue, open a bug — mobile coverage is
a 1.0.0 commitment.

## 16. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `503 setup_required` after fresh install | Wizard not completed | Open `/setup` |
| `401 mfa_required` after correct password | 2FA enabled | Enter the TOTP code |
| Cookies not sent on the API | `SECURE_COOKIES=true` on plain HTTP | Set `SECURE_COOKIES=false` for HTTP dev |
| Bank connection stuck `FAILED` | Bank refused the OAuth code | Click **Retry** on the requisition |
| Live prices stale | 15-minute cache | Wait or restart the backend |
| Login locked out | 5 attempts / 15 min | Wait 15 minutes |
| Lost authenticator phone | — | Use a recovery code, then re-enrol 2FA |
| Locked out entirely | — | Operator: reset DB or use admin reset (CLI) |

For deeper issues, the operator can inspect:

- Backend logs (Spring Boot stdout)
- `setup_audit` table (what the wizard did)
- `failed_login_attempts` (rate-limit state)

---

## 17. Privacy & data

- **No telemetry.** Picsou never phones home.
- **Encryption at rest.** TOTP secrets, exchange keys, bank session
  tokens, and broker refresh tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- **Backups are your responsibility.** Snapshot your PostgreSQL volume
  regularly.
- **Right to delete.** Deleting a member soft-deletes their domain
  data; a full hard-delete is performed by dropping the row in the
  database (operator-level).
