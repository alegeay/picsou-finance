## Overview

Picsou is a self-hosted personal-finance dashboard for an individual or a small family. It aggregates accounts from banks (PSD2/scraping), brokers (Trade Republic), crypto exchanges (Binance), and on-chain wallets (BTC/ETH/SOL); tracks balances over time, computes net worth, and helps members set savings goals, manage debts, and export their data. Each authenticated `AppUser` is linked to a `FamilyMember`, and every financial row is scoped by `member_id` with optional sharing.

## Main data flows

### 1. Bank sync

```
Client → SyncController → SyncService → BankConnectorPort → Enable Banking
```

Enable Banking (PSD2) is the canonical `BankConnectorPort` in 1.0.0. The Powens adapter (`PowensBankConnector`) ships in the codebase behind `@ConditionalOnExpression` but is **experimental and untested** — `@Primary` was removed for 1.0.0 so Enable Banking remains injected even when `POWENS_CLIENT_ID` is set. `SyncService.detectType()` maps provider types to the `AccountType` enum.

### 2. Price refresh

```
SchedulerService (cron) → PriceService → PriceProviderPort → CoinGecko / Yahoo Finance → 15-min cache
```

`SchedulerService` triggers daily refresh. `PriceService` holds a 15-minute in-memory cache. CoinGecko for crypto, Yahoo Finance for stocks/ETFs.

### 3. Trade Republic

```
Client → TradeRepublicController → TRSyncService → TRAdapter → tr-auth (Python) → TR WebSocket
```

Broker sync via Python microservice (Playwright automation). Two modes: automatic WebSocket sync and CSV import fallback. Session persisted in `TradeRepublicSession` entity.

### 4. Bourse Direct

```text
Client -> BourseDirectController -> BourseDirectSyncService -> BourseDirectPort
       -> BourseDirectAdapter -> internal FastAPI/Playwright sidecar -> Bourse Direct
```

The sidecar owns browser login, one-time-code completion and normalization of
modern/legacy portfolio streams. It returns only strict, reconciled snapshots.
The Java service queues imports, performs external calls outside database
transactions, then atomically replaces holdings and writes the daily account
snapshot. The encrypted browser state and observable job status live in
`BourseDirectSession`. See the [Bourse Direct ADR](./decisions/2026-07-21-bourse-direct-isolated-atomic-sync.md).

### 5. Crypto exchange

```
Client → CryptoExchangeController → CryptoSyncService → BinanceAdapter → Binance API
```

Binance API credentials encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (`CryptoEncryption`). `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var required.

### 6. Wallet sync

```
Client → WalletController → WalletSyncService → WalletPort → blockchain RPCs
```

Three adapters: Bitcoin (Blockstream Esplora, BIP32 xpub/zpub/descriptors), EVM (keyless PublicNode RPCs — one `0x` address fanned out across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche; native + curated ERC-20 tokens), Solana (RPC + curated SPL tokens). See the [EVM multichain wallets ADR](./decisions/2026-07-17-evm-multichain-wallets.md).

### 7. Dashboard

```
Client → DashboardController → DashboardService → Account + Snapshot + PriceService aggregation
```

Aggregates all account balances, applies current prices via `PriceService`, computes net worth and allocation breakdown.

### 8. Goals

```
Client → GoalController → GoalService → Goal + GoalMonthOverride repos
```

Savings goals with deadlines, linked to accounts via M:N join table (`goal_account`). Monthly tracking with optional per-month overrides.

### 9. First-launch setup wizard

```
Browser → SetupFilter → /setup → SetupController → SetupService → AppSetting / SetupAudit
                                                  → CryptoKeyGeneratorService
                                                  → EnableBankingKeyPairService
                                                  → IntegrationsService
```

`SetupFilter` redirects every request to `/setup` until `SetupState.completed = true`. The wizard collects admin credentials, security settings (CORS, encryption key), and per-integration credentials. Each step is appended to `setup_audit` (actor, IP, timestamp). After completion, the filter becomes a no-op.

### 10. Authentication & MFA

```
POST /api/auth/login → AuthController → (if 2FA) issue mfa_challenge JWT → 401 + cookie
POST /api/mfa/verify → MfaController → MfaService.verifyTotp() → issue access + refresh
                                    → optionally issue persistent_token (Remember Me)
Every request → JwtAuthenticationFilter → check tv claim vs AppUser.tokenVersion
              → PersistentTokenAuthFilter → re-issue access if persistent_token valid
```

Password change in `AuthController.changePassword` bumps `AppUser.tokenVersion`, revokes all `PersistentSession`s for the user, clears the persistent cookie, and re-issues fresh access/refresh cookies.

### 11. Family sharing

```
Member viewing dashboard → DashboardService scopes by UserContext.currentMemberId()
Family dashboard → FamilyViewController → FamilyViewService
                → for each FamilyMember: read SharingSettings (NONE / ALL / MANUAL)
                → if MANUAL, intersect with SharedResource(memberId, resourceType, resourceId)
```

Admins can use `/admin/impersonate/{memberId}` to view another member's data; `UserContext.getMemberIdOverride()` returns the override; audit trail in `setup_audit`.

### 12. GDPR data export

```
POST /api/me/export/reauth → ReAuthService verifies password (+ TOTP if enabled)
GET  /api/me/export        → DataExportService runs each EntityExporter
                          → emits a single ZIP containing JSON + CSV per entity
```

Wrapped in a read-only Spring transaction; rate-limited via `RateLimitConfig`.

### 13. Loan amortization

```
GET /api/accounts/{id}/loan-schedule → AccountController → LoanAmortizationService
                                    → returns monthly schedule (principal/interest split)
```

Computed on the fly from `Debt` (principal, rate, term, fees) — no per-month rows persisted. See ADR `2026-04-26-loan-amortization-on-the-fly.md`.

## External dependencies

| Service | Usage | Config |
|---------|-------|--------|
| PostgreSQL 16 | Persistence | `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` |
| Flyway | Schema migrations | `db/migration/` (latest V59) |
| Enable Banking | PSD2 bank sync (optional) | `ENABLEBANKING_*` |
| Powens / Budget Insight | Scraping bank sync (**experimental, disabled in 1.0.0**) | `POWENS_*` |
| Trade Republic | Broker sync via Python microservice | `TR_AUTH_URL` |
| Bourse Direct | PEA/CTO sync via internal Python sidecar | `BOURSE_DIRECT_AUTH_URL` |
| BoursoBank | Bank sync via Python sidecar (**disabled in 1.0.0**) | `BOURSO_AUTH_URL` |
| Binance | Crypto exchange balances | Via CryptoExchangePort |
| CoinGecko | Crypto prices (free) | No config |
| Yahoo Finance | Stock/ETF prices (free) | No config |
| PublicNode EVM RPCs | EVM wallet balances (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche) — native + curated ERC-20 | No config (keyless) |

| Blockstream Esplora | Bitcoin wallet balances | No config |
| Finary | Import xlsx or API sync (optional) | `FINARY_*` |

## Key constraints

- **Ports & adapters:** controllers/services never import adapters directly. All external integrations go through port interfaces.
- **Flyway owns schema:** never use `ddl-auto: create/update`. Every schema change is a new migration file (latest: V32).
- **Multi-member families:** each authenticated user is an `AppUser` linked to a `FamilyMember`. All financial rows are scoped by `member_id`; cross-member visibility is gated by `SharingSettings` + `SharedResource`. Admin role can impersonate any member.
- **Auth:** JWT (`access_token` + `refresh_token`) in HttpOnly `SameSite=Lax` cookies. Optional TOTP 2FA, rotating persistent sessions ("Remember Me"), stateless invalidation via `tokenVersion` claim on password change.
- **First-launch setup wizard:** on a fresh install, `SetupFilter` redirects to a wizard that creates the admin, configures CORS, generates the encryption key, and seeds integration credentials. No env-var editing required.
- **AES-256-GCM encryption:** crypto-exchange API secrets, bank session tokens, and Finary credentials encrypted at rest. `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be backed up — lost key means re-authenticating all integrations.
- **Scheduled tasks:** `SchedulerService` handles daily balance snapshots, price cache refresh, and per-member auto-sync.
- **Demo mode:** frontend-only, mock interceptor short-circuits API calls, no backend needed.
- **Secrets from environment variables or wizard store:** never hardcoded. Required at startup: `JWT_SECRET`, `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. `APP_USERNAME` / `APP_PASSWORD_HASH` are optional — the wizard creates the admin if they're absent.

## Disabled / experimental integrations

- **BoursoBank** — code (adapter, controller, V23 migration) and Python sidecar
  ship in 1.0.0 but the sidecar is commented out in `docker-compose.yml` and all
  UI entry points (setup wizard catalog, sync tab, admin toggle) are hidden.
  Re-enable only after the integration is finished and reviewed.
- **Powens / Budget Insight** — `PowensBankConnector` ships in 1.0.0 but is
  experimental and has not been tested end-to-end against a real Powens tenant.
  The `@Primary` annotation was removed so Enable Banking remains the injected
  `BankConnectorPort` even when `POWENS_CLIENT_ID` is set. Re-enable by
  re-adding `@Primary` once the adapter has been validated.
